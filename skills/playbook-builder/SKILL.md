description: Create comprehensive sales playbooks for products, segments, or sales motions. Use this skill whenever someone needs to build a sales playbook, create a new hire onboarding guide, document a sales process, standardize a sales motion, says "build a playbook for [product/segment]", "document our sales process", "create a selling guide", or when systematizing tribal knowledge into repeatable processes. Also trigger when someone mentions sales methodology documentation, go-to-market playbooks, vertical playbooks, or rep enablement guides.

# Playbook Builder

Create structured, actionable sales playbooks that turn your best reps' knowledge into a repeatable system the whole team can follow. A playbook isn't a PDF that sits on a shelf — it's a living reference that reps actually use in their day-to-day work.

## What Makes a Good Playbook

- **Actionable** — Every section answers "what do I do?" not just "what should I know?"
- **Scannable** — Reps look things up mid-conversation, not during study hall
- **Opinionated** — It takes a position on what works. "It depends" is useless guidance.
- **Evidence-based** — Grounded in what actually wins deals, not theory
- **Maintained** — Updated as the product, market, and competition evolve

## What I Need From You

The more context you provide, the more specific and useful the playbook:

1. **What you sell** — Product, pricing, key differentiators
2. **Who you sell to** — ICP, personas, typical buying committee
3. **How you sell** — Current process, sales stages, typical cycle length
4. **What works** — Your top reps' best practices, winning patterns
5. **What doesn't work** — Common mistakes, lost deal patterns
6. **Competitive landscape** — Who you compete against and how you differentiate

I'll supplement with research and proven frameworks, but your team's actual experience is the most valuable input.

## Tips for Building Great Playbooks

1. **Interview your top reps** — Their instincts contain gold that needs to be documented
2. **Include what NOT to do** — Failure patterns are as valuable as success patterns
3. **Keep it modular** — Reps should be able to jump to any section without reading the whole thing
4. **Version it** — Date everything and update quarterly at minimum
5. **Test it with new hires** — If a new rep can follow it and succeed, it's a good playbook
