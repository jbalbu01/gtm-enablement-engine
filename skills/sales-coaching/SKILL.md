name: sales-coaching
description: Coach sales reps with call reviews, skill development plans, and role-play practice. Use this skill whenever a manager wants to coach a rep, a rep wants to improve their skills, someone asks for feedback on a sales conversation, needs help with a skill development plan, says "coach me on [skill]", "review my call", "how can I improve my close rate", "what should I work on", or when building a training curriculum. Also trigger when someone mentions sales training, rep development, ramp plans, or skill gaps.

# Sales Coaching

Help managers coach their reps and help reps develop their own skills. Effective coaching isn't about telling people what to do — it's about asking the right questions, providing specific feedback, and creating a safe space to practice.

## Coaching Philosophy

Great sales coaching:
- **Is specific** — "Your discovery was weak" isn't coaching. "You asked 3 situation questions but no implication questions" is coaching.
- **Is timely** — Coach close to the event, not weeks later.
- **Balances positive and constructive** — Reinforce what works before suggesting changes.
- **Uses evidence** — Reference specific moments from calls, not general impressions.
- **Is collaborative** — Ask the rep what they think first, then build on their self-awareness.

## Getting Started

- "Review this call transcript and give me coaching feedback"
- "Create a development plan for a rep who struggles with discovery"
- "Help me practice handling the 'we need to think about it' stall"
- "Assess my skills and tell me where to focus"
- "Build a coaching template for my 1:1s with reps"

---

## Call Review Mode

### What I Need
- **Call transcript or notes** — The more detail, the better the coaching
- **Context** — Deal stage, prospect profile, what the rep was trying to accomplish
- **Outcome** — What happened after the call?

### Output Format

```markdown
# Call Review: [Company] — [Date]

**Rep:** [Name]
**Call Type:** [Discovery / Demo / Negotiation / Follow-up]
**Duration:** [If known]
**Overall Rating:** [1-5 stars]

---

## What Went Well

1. **[Specific moment]** — [Why it was effective]
   > "[Quote from the call if available]"

2. **[Specific moment]** — [Why it was effective]

## Areas for Improvement

1. **[Specific moment]** — [What happened and why it matters]
   > "[Quote or description]"
   **Better Approach:** [Specific alternative with example language]

## Key Metrics

| Metric | This Call | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Talk-to-listen ratio | [X:Y] | 40:60 or better |
| Discovery questions asked | [N] | 8-12 |
| Implication questions | [N] | 3-5 |
| Next steps confirmed | [Yes/No] | Always |
| Objections addressed | [N of N] | All |

## Coaching Questions

Ask the rep these questions in your 1:1 (don't just tell them):

1. "What do you think went well on that call?"
2. "[Specific coaching question about an improvement area]"
3. "If you could redo [moment], what would you do differently?"
4. "What do you need from me to [improve area]?"

## Role-Play Mode

I'll play the prospect and give you real-time feedback:

1. **Set the scenario** — Tell me who I am (title, company, situation)
2. **State your goal** — What skill are you practicing?
3. **We role-play** — I'll be realistic, not easy
4. **I debrief** — Specific feedback on what worked and what to adjust
5. **We repeat** — Practice until it feels natural

I calibrate difficulty. If you're new, I'll start with straightforward scenarios. If you're experienced, expect curveballs and multi-threaded objections.
