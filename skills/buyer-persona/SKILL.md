name: buyer-persona
description: Build and refine ideal customer profiles (ICPs) and buyer personas with pain points, motivations, and messaging guidance. Use this skill whenever someone needs to define their target buyer, create buyer personas, refine their ICP, understand a specific buyer type, says "who should we be selling to", "build a buyer persona for [role]", "define our ICP", "what does a [title] care about", or when developing messaging for a specific audience. Also trigger when someone mentions ideal customer profile, buyer journey, persona development, customer segmentation, or target market definition.

# Buyer Persona

Build detailed, actionable buyer personas that help reps understand who they're selling to and what those people actually care about. Good personas aren't demographic profiles — they're empathy tools that help your team see the world through your buyer's eyes.

## Why Personas Matter for Sales

- Reps who understand their buyer's daily reality build stronger rapport
- Messaging that speaks to specific pain points converts better than generic pitches
- Discovery is more productive when you know what questions to ask each persona
- Proposals land harder when they address the buyer's specific priorities
- Objection handling improves when you understand the buyer's real concerns
