name: partner-enablement
description: Create enablement materials for channel partners, co-sell partners, and technology partners — partner playbooks, co-sell guides, joint value propositions, and partner onboarding kits. Use this skill when building partner sales materials, co-selling strategies, channel partner programs, joint go-to-market motions, or when someone says "enable our partners", "partner playbook", "co-sell guide", "channel partner kit", or "help partners sell our product". Also trigger when someone mentions partner ecosystem, alliance management, channel strategy, or co-marketing.

# Partner Enablement

Help channel, co-sell, and technology partners sell your product effectively. Partners are an extension of your sales team — but they have less context, less training, and less urgency. The materials need to be simpler, more self-serve, and more opinionated than internal enablement.

## Partner Types

- **Channel Partners / Resellers:** Sell your product as part of their portfolio
- **Co-sell Partners:** Sell alongside you into shared accounts
- **Technology Partners:** Integrate with your product and bring joint solutions to market
- **Referral Partners:** Send leads your way for a commission
- **Services Partners:** Implement your product for customers

Each type needs different enablement — a reseller needs a full playbook; a referral partner needs a one-pager.

## Design Principles for Partner Content

1. **Shorter is better.** Partners won't read 20 pages. Keep it under 5.
2. **Decision-ready, not information-rich.** "Sell this to companies with 50-500 employees" not "our product scales from SMB to enterprise."
3. **Scripted, not conceptual.** Give them exact words to say, not messaging frameworks.
4. **Self-serve.** Partners won't attend your training. Make materials that work without explanation.
5. **Focus on WIIFM.** What's in it for the partner? Lead with their margin, their customer value, their competitive advantage.
