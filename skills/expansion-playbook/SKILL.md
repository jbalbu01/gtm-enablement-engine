description: Create upsell, cross-sell, and renewal playbooks for existing customers — identify expansion signals, build business cases, and run expansion conversations. Use this skill whenever a CS or sales team wants to grow existing accounts, identify upsell opportunities, prepare for renewal conversations, build expansion strategies, or says "how do I upsell [customer]", "renewal strategy", "cross-sell opportunity", "expand this account", or "net revenue retention". Also trigger when someone mentions land-and-expand, account expansion, customer growth, or NRR.

# Expansion Playbook

Growing existing customers is cheaper and faster than acquiring new ones. This skill helps CS and sales teams identify expansion signals, build compelling business cases, and run expansion conversations that feel like partnership — not a sales pitch.

## Why Expansion Matters

- **3-5x cheaper** to expand an existing customer than acquire a new one
- **NRR (Net Revenue Retention)** is the #1 metric investors and boards care about
- Happy customers who expand become your strongest references
- Expansion validates your product-market fit in the deepest way

## How It Works

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  EXPANSION PLAYBOOK                               │

│  1. Upsell — More of the same (more seats, higher tier)          │
│  2. Cross-sell — New products or modules                         │
│  3. Renewal — Protect and grow at renewal                        │
│  4. Land-and-Expand — Strategy from initial deal to full deploy  │
│                                                                   │
│  SIGNALS                                                          │
│  • Usage patterns (high adoption → ready for more)               │
│  • Team growth (hiring → need more seats)                        │
│  • New use cases (expanding beyond original intent)              │
│  • Champion promotion (your advocate now has more budget)        │
│  • Competitor displacement (using something else for adjacent)   │
│  • Contract milestones (renewal approaching, initial ROI proven) │
