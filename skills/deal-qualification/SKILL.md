name: deal-qualification
description: Qualify sales deals using MEDDIC, BANT, SPICED, or CHAMP frameworks with structured scoring and gap analysis. Use this skill whenever a rep needs to qualify a deal, assess deal health, decide whether to invest more time in an opportunity, says "should I pursue this deal", "qualify this opportunity", "MEDDIC score", "BANT check", or asks about deal qualification criteria. Also trigger when a manager reviews pipeline quality or when someone mentions deal scoring, opportunity assessment, or go/no-go decisions.

# Deal Qualification

Help reps and managers objectively assess whether a deal is worth pursuing, identify gaps in qualification, and decide where to invest their time. The worst thing in sales is spending months on a deal that was never going to close — qualification prevents that.

## Frameworks

### MEDDIC (Recommended for Enterprise B2B SaaS)
The gold standard for complex, multi-stakeholder deals:

- **M — Metrics:** What quantifiable outcomes does the prospect expect?
- **E — Economic Buyer:** Who has the budget authority and final say?
- **D — Decision Criteria:** What factors will they use to choose a vendor?
- **D — Decision Process:** What are the steps, stakeholders, and timeline?
- **I — Identify Pain:** What specific problem are they solving?
- **C — Champion:** Who inside the account is actively selling for you?

### BANT (Good for Simpler or Faster Sales Cycles)
- **B — Budget:** Do they have money allocated?
- **A — Authority:** Are you talking to the decision-maker?
- **N — Need:** Do they have a real problem you solve?
- **T — Timeline:** Is there urgency to act?

### SPICED (Good for Customer-Centric Selling)
- **S — Situation:** What's their current state?
- **P — Pain:** What's broken or missing?
- **I — Impact:** What happens if they don't fix it?
- **C — Critical Event:** Is there a forcing function or deadline?
- **E — Economic Decision:** Who decides and how?
- **D — Decision Criteria:** How will they evaluate options?

## What I Need From You

Tell me everything you know about the deal. I'll figure out what's missing.

1. **Company and deal size** — Who and how big?
2. **What you're selling** — Product, use case, proposed solution
3. **Who you're talking to** — Names, titles, roles in the decision
4. **What you've learned** — Pain points, requirements, timeline
5. **Where you are in the process** — Stage, next steps, blockers
6. **Framework preference** — MEDDIC, BANT, SPICED, or "you decide"

## Scoring Guide

Each criterion scores 0-5:

- **5 — Fully Validated:** Clear evidence, confirmed by the prospect
- **4 — Strong Indication:** Good evidence but not fully confirmed
- **3 — Partial:** Some information but significant gaps remain
- **2 — Assumed:** Based on inference, not direct confirmation
- **1 — Unknown:** We know we need this but don't have it
- **0 — Missing/Negative:** No information or actively concerning signals

## Pipeline Audit Mode

When reviewing multiple deals, I'll produce a ranked list:

| 2 | [Deal B] | $X | 21/30 | Medium | [Risk] | [Action] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Summary
- **Strong deals:** [Count] worth $[total]
- **At-risk deals:** [Count] worth $[total] — need attention this week
